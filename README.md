# Image-Dehazing-based-on-ROP
Image dehazing was a type of scene recovery designed to reduce or eliminate the effects of image blurring and reduced contrast caused by haze, atmospheric pollution, or other atmospheric particles. The purpose of this article was to describe a real-time scene recovery framework that could be used to recover degraded images under different weather conditions and imaging conditions, such as underwater, sand dust, and haze. An image that was degraded could actually be viewed as a superimposition of a clear image with the same color imaging environment (underwater, sand, fog, etc.) To characterize this phenomenon mathematically, a rank-one matrix could be introduced, i.e., rank-one prior (ROP). In this article, six new frameworks of dehazing algorithms were developed by combining ROP with Color Transfer and two image sharpening techniques, Unsharp Masking and Sharpening based on Neumann series. Comprehensive experiments on scene recovery showed that the method proposed in this paper outperforms ROP+ in terms of efficiency and demonstrated a very high degree of superiority in terms of performance.
